## Conceptual Roadmap for ast_tool_v5.py
Argument Parsing (main function):

## Modify your argparse.ArgumentParser to handle the new requirements.
The positional argument for filenames will need nargs='+' to accept one or more file paths.
Add an optional argument using parser.add_argument('-o', '--output', ...) to capture the output path.
Core Logic (A new, importable function):

It's a great idea to create a central function, let's call it analyze_and_write_files, that can be imported and used as a library.
This function will take a list of input Path objects and an optional output Path.
Inside, it will need to handle the different scenarios:
If there's only one input file: Check if an output path was given. If yes, write to that file. If no, print to the console (the old behavior).
If there are multiple input files: The output path should be a directory. You'll loop through each input file, generate a unique output filename for it (like greet_ast.txt), and save it in the output directory.
File Processing (Helper function):

Keep your existing logic for handling a single file (reading it, parsing it, and handling IOError or SyntaxError) in a clean helper function like get_ast_from_file. This keeps your code modular and easy to test.
